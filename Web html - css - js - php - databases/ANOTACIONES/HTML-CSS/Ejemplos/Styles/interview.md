## 2. TECHNICAL QUESTIONS
### (Preguntas Técnicas)

### Q3: Can you explain your understanding of web application architecture and the technologies involved?

**Answer:**
Certainly! In my experience building web applications, I work with a multi-layered architecture:

**Client-side**: I develop responsive user interfaces using HTML5 for structure, CSS3 for styling, and JavaScript with React.js for interactive, component-based applications. I'm familiar with how browsers interpret these technologies and how Ajax enables asynchronous communication without page reloads.

**Server-side**: I've worked with Python and Django framework for back-end development, where I handle business logic, authentication, and data processing. I also have basic experience with PHP and Laravel. These server-side technologies process HTTP requests and generate dynamic responses.

**Database layer**: I've created databases using PostgreSQL and MySQL, implementing proper data access practices and SQL queries to ensure efficient data retrieval and storage.

**Communication**: I understand how the HTTP protocol works as the foundation for data communication, and I'm familiar with RESTful architectural style for designing APIs that enable front-end and back-end communication.

Throughout my studies at Jala University, I've worked remotely on Linux virtual machines, establishing SSH connections and managing development environments entirely through the console, which has strengthened my understanding of the underlying infrastructure.

---

### Q4: Tell me about your experience with version control and collaborative development workflows.

**Answer:**
Version control is essential to my development process. I use Git daily and have experience with both GitHub and GitLab for collaborative workflows.

In my projects, I follow best practices such as:
- Creating feature branches for new development
- Writing clear, descriptive commit messages
- Performing code reviews before merging
- Resolving merge conflicts when working with team members
- Using pull requests for collaborative feedback

At Jala University, we've extensively used Git in team projects, implementing agile methodologies where multiple developers work simultaneously on different features. This taught me the importance of communication, proper branching strategies, and maintaining clean commit history.

I've also participated in code reviews, both giving and receiving feedback, which has helped me learn best practices and improve code quality across the team.

---

### Q5: What do you know about application performance monitoring, and why is it important?

**Answer:**
Application performance monitoring is crucial for ensuring software works optimally in production environments. While I haven't worked directly with APM tools like Dynatrace yet, I understand the core concepts from my development experience.

Performance monitoring helps identify:
- **Response time bottlenecks**: Where applications slow down
- **Resource utilization**: CPU, memory, and network usage patterns
- **Error rates and exceptions**: Problems affecting user experience
- **Database query performance**: Slow queries impacting overall performance

The proactive approach to monitoring is what I find most valuable. Rather than waiting for users to report issues, real-time analytics allow teams to detect and resolve problems before they impact customers. This aligns with my problem-solving approach—I prefer preventing issues rather than just fixing them after they occur.

I'm excited to learn Dynatrace's platform during the PDP program and understand how it provides end-to-end visibility across the entire software application lifecycle.

---

### Q6: Can you explain what REST APIs are and how you've worked with them?

**Answer:**
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs use HTTP methods to perform operations on resources.

In my projects, I've integrated front-end applications with back-end APIs using:
- **GET** requests to retrieve data
- **POST** requests to create new resources
- **PUT/PATCH** for updating existing data
- **DELETE** for removing resources

For example, in my React applications, I've used fetch API and axios to communicate with Django back-end services. I ensure proper error handling, manage authentication tokens, and handle asynchronous operations using promises and async/await.

I understand that REST APIs should be stateless, use standard HTTP status codes, and follow consistent resource naming conventions. This makes them easy to understand, scale, and maintain—principles I always try to follow when working with or designing APIs.
